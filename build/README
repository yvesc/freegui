This is an x64 distribution for FreeNAS VERSION
built on BUILD_TIMESTAMP (yyyymmdd format).

If you are seeing this README file, this is a daily build created for
testing purposes.  You should, of course, run any daily build at your
own risk, and on non-mission-critical data, since it obviously has not
been deemed fully release-ready and may suffer from any number of issues!

Please feel free to report bugs for this build (http://bugs.freenas.org)
but please be also sure to note the build version and timestamp as above,
since otherwise we will have no idea which build contains the bug being
reported.  These bug reports are VERY valuable to us and will be looked
at, since fixing them early is what keeps our builds of consistently
high quality.

Thanks!

The FreeNAS development team
