# CUPS configuration file, generated by CUPS configuration tool.
# This tool is part of KDEPrint, the printing framework for KDE
# since version 2.2.2 and is used by the CUPS supporting module
# in KDEPrint. The predecessors to KDEPrint in former KDE releases
# were KUPS and QtCUPS; they are deprecated and no longer maintained.

# This is the CUPS configuration file.  If you are familiar with       #
# Apache or any of the other popular web servers, we've followed the   #
# same format.  Any configuration variable used here has the same      #
# semantics as the corresponding variable in Apache.  If we need       #
# different functionality then a different name is used to avoid       #
# confusion...                                                         #

# Server

# Server name (ServerName)
# 
# The hostname of your server, as advertised to the world.
# By default CUPS will use the hostname of the system.
# 
# To set the default server used by clients, see the client.conf file.
# 
# ex: myhost.domain.com
#
#ServerName myhost.domain.com


# Server administrator (ServerAdmin)
# 
# The email address to send all complaints or problems to.
# By default CUPS will use "root@hostname".
# 
# ex: root@myhost.com
#
#ServerAdmin root@your.domain.com


# Classification (Classification)
# 
# The classification level of the server.  If set, this
# classification is displayed on all pages, and raw printing is disabled.
# The default is the empty string.
# 
# ex: confidential
#
#Classification classified

Classification none

# Allow overrides (ClassifyOverride)
# 
# Whether to allow users to override the classification
# on printouts. If enabled, users can limit banner pages to before or
# after the job, and can change the classification of a job, but cannot
# completely eliminate the classification or banners.
# 
# The default is off.
#
#ClassifyOverride off


# Default character set (DefaultCharset)
# 
# The default character set to use. If not specified,

# HTML documents...
# 
# ex: utf-8
#
#DefaultCharset utf-8

# Access permissions
#
# Access permissions for each directory served by the scheduler.
# Locations are relative to DocumentRoot...
#
# AuthType: the authorization to use:
#
#    None   - Perform no authentication
#    Basic  - Perform authentication using the HTTP Basic method.
#    Digest - Perform authentication using the HTTP Digest method.
#
#    (Note: local certificate authentication can be substituted by
#           the client for Basic or Digest when connecting to the
#           localhost interface)
#
# AuthClass: the authorization class; currently only Anonymous, User,
# System (valid user belonging to group SystemGroup), and Group
# (valid user belonging to the specified group) are supported.
#
# AuthGroupName: the group name for "Group" authorization.
#
# Order: the order of Allow/Deny processing.
#
# Allow: allows access from the specified hostname, domain, IP address, or
# network.

#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mm
#     nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm
#
# The host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups
# with "HostNameLookups On" above.
#
# Encryption: whether or not to use encryption; this depends on having
# the OpenSSL library linked into the CUPS library and scheduler.
#
# Possible values:
#
#     Always       - Always use encryption (SSL)
#     Never        - Never use encryption
#     Required     - Use TLS encryption upgrade
#     IfRequested  - Use encryption if the server requests it
#
# The default value is "IfRequested".

# 
# You can have multiple Port/Listen lines to listen to more than one
# port or address, or to restrict access.
# 
# Note: Unfortunately, most web browsers don't support TLS or HTTP Upgrades
# for encryption.  If you want to support web-based encryption you will
# probably need to listen on port 443 (the "HTTPS" port...).
# 
# ex: 631, myhost:80, 1.2.3.4:631
#
#    Port 80
#    Port 631

# 
# ex: 200
#
#FilterLimit 0

FilterLimit 0

# Browsing

# Use browsing (Browsing)
# 
# Whether or not to listen to printer 
# information from other CUPS servers.  
# 
# 
# Enabled by default.
# 
# 
# Note: to enable the sending of browsing
# information from this CUPS server to the LAN,
# specify a valid BrowseAddress.
# 
# 
# ex: On
#
#Browsing On

Browsing On

# Browse protocols (BrowseProtocols)
# 
# Which protocols to use for browsing.  Can be
# any of the following separated by whitespace and/or commas:
# 
#     all  - Use all supported protocols.
#     cups - Use the CUPS browse protocol.
#     slp  - Use the SLPv2 protocol.
# 
# The default is cups.
# 
# Note: If you choose to use SLPv2, it is strongly recommended that
#       you have at least one SLP Directory Agent (DA) on your
#       network.  Otherwise, browse updates can take several seconds,
#       during which the scheduler will not response to client
#       requests.
#
#BrowseProtocols cups

BrowseProtocols CUPS 

# Browse port (BrowsePort)
# 
# The port used for UDP broadcasts.  By default this is
# the IPP port; if you change this you need to do it on all servers.
# Only one BrowsePort is recognized.
# 
# ex: 631
#
#BrowsePort 631

BrowsePort 631

# Browse interval (BrowseInterval)
# 
# The time between browsing updates in seconds.  Default
# is 30 seconds.
# 
# Note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer's state changes
# as well, so this represents the maximum time between updates.
# 
# Set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are
# not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts.
# 
# ex: 30
#
#BrowseInterval 30

BrowseInterval 30

# Browse timeout (BrowseTimeout)
# 
# The timeout (in seconds) for network printers - if we don't
# get an update within this time the printer will be removed
# from the printer list.  This number definitely should not be
# less the BrowseInterval value for obvious reasons.  Defaults
# to 300 seconds.
# 
# ex: 300
#
#BrowseTimeout 300

BrowseTimeout 300

# Browse addresses (BrowseAddress)
# 
# Specifies a broadcast address to be used.  By
# default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces.
# 
# Note: HP-UX 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless
# you have a Class A, B, C, or D netmask (i.e. no CIDR support).
# 
# ex: x.y.z.255, x.y.255.255
#

# Implicit classes (ImplicitClasses)
# 
# Whether or not to use implicit classes.
# 
# Printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes.conf
# file, implicitly based upon the printers available on the LAN, or
# both.
# 
# When ImplicitClasses is On, printers on the LAN with the same name
# (e.g. Acme-LaserPrint-1000) will be put into a class with the same
# name. This allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a LAN
# without a lot of administrative difficulties.  If a user sends a
# job to Acme-LaserPrint-1000, the job will go to the first available
# queue.
# 
# Enabled by default.
#
#ImplicitClasses Off

ImplicitClasses On

# Use &quot;any&quot; classes (ImplicitAnyClasses)
# 
# Whether or not to create AnyPrinter implicit
# classes.
# 
# When ImplicitAnyClasses is On and a local queue of the same name
# exists, e.g. "printer", "printer@server1", "printer@server1", then
# an implicit class called "Anyprinter" is created instead.
# 
# When ImplicitAnyClasses is Off, implicit classes are not created
# when there is a local queue of the same name.
# 
# Disabled by default.
#
#ImplicitAnyCLasses Off

ImplicitAnyClasses Off

# Hide implicit members (HideImplicitMembers)
# 
# Whether or not to show the members of an
# implicit class.
# 
# When HideImplicitMembers is On, any remote printers that are
# part of an implicit class are hidden from the user, who will
# then only see a single queue even though many queues will be
# supporting the implicit class.
# 
# Enabled by default.
#
#HideImplicitMembers On

HideImplicitMembers Yes

# Use short names (BrowseShortNames)
# 
# Whether or not to use "short" names for remote printers
# when possible (e.g. "printer" instead of "printer@host").  Enabled by
# default.
# 
# ex: Yes
#
#BrowseShortNames Yes
